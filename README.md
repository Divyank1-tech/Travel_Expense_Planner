# Overview of the project
The Travel Expense Planner is a single, complete, command-line application written in python designed to track and manage trip finances. It features a menu-driven interface for logging expenses, setting budgets, and generating a detailed summary. Most importantly, it uses local JSON file handling to ensure data is saved automatically upon exit and loaded upon startup, providing state continuity for long-term trip planning.
